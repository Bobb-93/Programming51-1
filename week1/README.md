# Week 1

## Development environment setup

Things you need to start this course:

* [Install Java and JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Install Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
* [How to install Java on Ubuntu / Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14788345/how-to-install-jdk-on-ubuntu-linux)

## Task 1

Try to find the maximum value of `int` with a `while`/`for` cycle:

What will happen if you increase an `int` variable a lot of times?
Can you increase a positive `int` value so many times, that it gets negative?
Try to do that in a Java program.

## Task 2

Try to find the maximum value of `long`, `float` and `double` variables.

 * A `long` variable can contain numbers without a floating point. Guess the difference between `int` and `long`
 * A `float` variable is a number that has a floating point. Like 2.6 or 45.832
 * A `double` variable is also a number with a floating point. Try to guess the difference between `float` and `double`
