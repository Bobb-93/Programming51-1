# 5-Fraction

In a `com.hackbulgaria.programming51.week2` package create a `Fraction` class where you:

* Define a fraction with numerator and denominator.
* Create a method `public float getReal()` that returns the fraction as a number with a decimal point.
* Create a method `public void sum(Fraction F)` that sums the current Fraction with another Fraction
* Create a method `public simplify()` that simplifies your `Fraction`

Example:
If `numerator = 4;`
And `denominator = 12`

Then `simplify()` should change:
`numerator = 1`
And
`denominator = 3`
