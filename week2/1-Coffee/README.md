# 1-Coffee

In a `com.hackbulgaria.programming51.week2` package create a `Coffee` class, where you:

* Define attributes for `Coffee` that have `brand` and `price` Think about their types.
* Make several objects of type `Coffee` and print them.
* Define `public String toString() {}` for `Coffee`.

Example, in main:


```java
Coffee java = new Coffee();
java.brand = "Java";
java.price = 1.00f;
System.out.println(java);
```

Should print:

```java
Java: 1.00
```
