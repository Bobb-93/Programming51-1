# 1-Coffee

In a `com.hackbulgaria.programming51.week2` package create a `Coffee` class, where you:

* Define attributes for `class Coffee` that have `brand` and `price` Think about their types.
* Make several objects of type `Coffee` and print them
* Define `toString`

Example:

In main:

```java
Coffee Java = new Coffee();
Java.brand = "Java";
Java.price = 1.00f;
System.out.println(Java);
```

Should print:

```java
Java: 1.00
```
